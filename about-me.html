        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>My name is Cristiano Donadio, I was born in Belluno, a small city in the north-east of Italy,
        in 1997.</p>
        <p class="indented">I studied languages, both at high school and at Ca' Foscari University in Venice,
        which allowed me to
        reach a good level in English and a basic knowledge of French and Japanese. I'm now moving to Vancouver,
        Canada to pursuit a career in web developing which I'm currently studying.</p>
        <p class="indented"> I have a lot of different passions and hobbies, one of them is clearly Web
        Developing that I still need to nurture and delve into. At the same time, I enjoy every form of art,
        from literature to videogames, from cinematography to painting, to niche topics like action figuring and
        model building.</p>
        <p class="indented">I believe one is a student for one's whole life, I'm always trying to acquire new knowledge
        through simple discussion or methodical reading. I'm never satisfied with what I know and I'm constantly
        looking for new experiences, personal or professional, to improve myself. I'm a hard worker, I believe in
        teamwork but also in finding your own place and trying your best to overcome your limits on your own.
        The three main words in the homepage define my personal view.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Precision: because I don't appreciate approximation and hastiness;</li>
          <li>Discipline: because I'm aware of my role in any environment;</li>
          <li>Work ethic: because I respect and appreciate my colleagues efforts.</li>
